Itunes KISS

Just a simple erlang script to remove all media duplicated files inside a directory, and subdirectories.

In order to remove all your Itunes duplicated files:

itunes_kiss:remove_duplicates("/Users/sergioveiga/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music").         
ok

All the process runs in background, so dont worry when it ends it will send this kind of message with the number of duplicated files removed.

Duplicated files removed with sucess : 316

I'm using as filter for duplicated songs {Title,Artist,Album} and the first found is the one that will remain.

Would be nice to use a sophisticated filter that could ensure that we keep the file with better bitrate for example.
